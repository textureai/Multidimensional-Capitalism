Multi-Dimensional Capitalism (MDC) is a conceptual framework and modeling toolkit designed to analyze, simulate, and optimize systems of value creation and exchange across multiple forms of capitalâ€”beyond purely financial metrics. MDC enables researchers, policymakers, and organizational leaders to map interactions between diverse capital types such as economic, social, cultural, intellectual, moral, narrative, computational, and temporal capital, and to evaluate system coherence, degenerative currents, and transformation pathways.
